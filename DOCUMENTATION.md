# Project Documentation: Todo & Project Manager

## 1. Problem Statement
Many people find it hard to keep track of their daily tasks and projects. Writing things down on paper can be messy, and notes can get lost. When working with a team, it is even harder to know who is doing what and when it will be finished. This app solves these problems by providing a digital place to store and organize work.

## 2. Project Objectives and Target Users
### Project Objectives:
*   To help people organize their work in a clean and easy way.
*   To allow teams to work together on the same projects.
*   To show the progress of tasks using a visual board (Kanban).

### Target Users:
*   **Students**: To manage their homework and projects.
*   **Small Teams**: To track work progress together.
*   **Busy Individuals**: To plan their daily tasks and stay productive.

## 3. Functional Requirements (What the app does)
*   **User Accounts**: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
